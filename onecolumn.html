                <p>During my early childhood years, I was fascinated with what I could do with a Commodore 64. My
                  love for computers continued through my teenage years, inspiring me to build my first PC for my senior
                  project. I have spent over a decade trying to decide what profession is best suited for me to truly help
                  people. I have tested the service industry, but have worked most of my adult years in security. What I have learned
                  is that while I enjoyed success in most things I've done, I wasn't making a global change. Web development allows
                  me to reach a larger group of people and make their lives better at a rapid rate.                  
                </p>
                <p>I am looking to work for a company that values their clients, community, and workforce. I would also like to work
                  with non-profit organizations who primarily focus on veteran services or childhood trauma victims.
